Grids can be in any dimension and be Boundless or bounded. At minimum, a grid stores its discretization cell and origin in pixels.  For an orthogonal grid, supply a list of resolutions in each dimension. For non-orthogonal grid, supply the cell vectors as a column-wise matrix. Origin by default is at index (1, ...).\n\nBounded grids compute and store additional info eg position vectors and their norms of all grid points.

Equivariance means a rotation of the input results in the same rotation of the output thus preserving symmetry. Applying a linear operator convolves the input with the operator's kernel. If the operator is also equivariant, then its kernel must be radially symmetric. Differential operators and Green's functions are in fact equivariant linear operators. We provide built in constructors for these common operators. By parameterizing the radial function, we can also construct custom neural equivariant operators for machine learning.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Publications","page":"Home","title":"Publications","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Preprint: Paul Shen, Michael Herbst, Venkat Viswanathan.
